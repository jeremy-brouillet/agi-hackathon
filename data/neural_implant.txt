Project 4: Apple Neural Implant
Description: Apple's Neural Implant project is at the forefront of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. It aims to develop an implantable device that allows direct communication between the human brain and Apple devices, opening new possibilities for people with disabilities and enhancing human-machine interaction.
OKRs:
	•	Objective: Advance human-computer interaction through neural implants.
	•	Key Result 1: Successfully test a neural implant in clinical trials with 100 patients.
	•	Key Result 2: Develop a neural interface for controlling Apple devices with thought commands.
	•	Key Result 3: Secure FDA approval for neural implant technology within five years.
